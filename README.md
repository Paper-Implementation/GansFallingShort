# repository for Exposure Bias experiments

### TODOs

(MASS): run MLE hparam search

(MASS): Pick an MLE model and make it an Oracle for the LM score (add it on the repo and make default it)

(MASS): run GAN hparam search (crossvalidating with LM score)

#### Then,

(): add neural network distance to hidden state analysis (Hugo's idea)

(): add "Condition on the starting tokens of test data" experiment to evaluate robustness/generalization
