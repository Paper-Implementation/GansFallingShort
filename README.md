# repository for Exposure Bias experiments

### TODOs

(MASS): rerun word-level MLE hparam search (cuz need new Oracle)

(MASS): run char-level MLE hyperaram search for Oracle

(MASS): add an fast (and approximate) TSNE implementation --> Run TSNE on hidden states sequences 

(MASS): Exposure bias w.r.t training data :o

(MASS): compare exposure bias in char-level vs word-level

(MASS): run GAN hparam search (crossvalidating with LM score)


#### Then,


(): add "Condition on the starting tokens of test data" experiment to evaluate robustness/generalization
