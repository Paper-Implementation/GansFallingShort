# repository for Exposure Bias experiments

### TODOs


(MASS): run GAN hparam search (crossvalidating with LM score)

(MASS): monitor conditional entropy w.r.t timesteps

(MASS): make tsne early stop

#### Then,

(): add neural network distance to hidden state analysis (Hugo's idea)

(): add "Condition on the starting tokens of test data" experiment to evaluate robustness/generalization
